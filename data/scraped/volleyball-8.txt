February 28, 2002
The NCAA Women's Volleyball Rules Committee, at its February 18-21 meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona, approved several rules changes for the 2002 women's volleyball season including the use of the libero player with 12 substitutions. It will be the first year the NCAA is writing rules for collegiate women's volleyball.
After gathering information from a variety of junior, collegiate and international volleyball coaches and experts, the committee adopted the libero as a designated back-row player who cannot serve, attack or set inside the attack line. Attached is a list of frequently asked questions to help coaches understand the position and its use in play .
Terry Pettit, chair of the committee, said, "We believe the adoption of the libero will add a new element of excitement to the game, raise the level of play and has the potential to create opportunities for the smaller athlete."
Other important rules changes adopted for 2002 are:
The use of the pursuit rule allowing players to retrieve a ball that has crossed the centerline outside the court under certain circumstances.
In a deciding game, teams must switch sides at eight points.
Expulsion or disqualification of a player results in a loss of rally (point for the opposing team).
Net sleeves will be allowed on the top of the net with adequate securing devices.
No change was made in the way individual red cards are issued. Games will still be played to 30 points for games one through four, and to 15 points in the deciding game. 
Changes in scorekeeping for expediency and libero tracking have been implemented to support these developments. Final rules language is being developed and will be distributed to coaches at a later date. Also at that time, information regarding data collection and the rules survey will be made available.
