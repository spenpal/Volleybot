Basic Rules of Volleyball Each of the two teams consists of six players, three located in front of the attack line and three behind.
To get play started, a player from a team chosen by a coin toss (the server) throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team’s court (the serve).
The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent’s side of the net.
These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball’s trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (an over-hand pass using finger-tip action) by the setter so that the ball’s trajectory is aimed towards one or more players designated as the attacker and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent’s court) to return the ball over the net.
The team with possession of the ball and that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offense.
The team on defense attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court by having players at the net jump and reach above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net in order to block the attacked ball.
If the ball is hit around, above or through the block, the defensive players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig (a fore-arm pass of a hard-driven ball).
After a successful dig, the team transitions to offense.
The game continues in this manner until the ball touches the court within the boundaries or until an error is made.
