As a student at the Springfield College in Massachusets, he had befriended James Naismith who, in 1891, had himself invented basketball.
After graduating, Morgan went on to become director of physical education at the Young Manâ€™s Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusets and it was there that he devised his new sport, which was designed to be a combination of basketball, baseball, tennis and handball.
Until the early 1930s volleyball was for the most part a game of leisure and recreation, and there were only a few international activities and competitions.
There were different rules of the game in the various parts of the world; however, national championships were played in many countries (for instance, in Eastern Europe where the level of play had reached a remarkable standard).
