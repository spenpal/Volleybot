Volleyball is a game played by two opposing teams usually made up of six players each.
The players use their hands to hit the ball over a high net, trying to make it touch the ground on the opposing team's side, scoring a point.
Volleyball, invented in Holyoke, Massachusetts in 1895, combines the elements of tennis, handball, basketball and baseball.
Not surprisingly, with so much action, the game has spawned a rich vocabulary to describe its rules and play.
In volleyball, each team plays with three players in the front row, near the net, and three in the back row.
The front and back row players are separated by the attack line, a line on the court 3 meters from the net.
Volleyball players on the serving team rotate clockwise each time they get the ball to serve.
The player serving continues to serve until her team loses the ball.
Volleyball players need to be in great shape since they jump about 300 times per game.
In volleyball, the word is generally used as a verb -- an action word.
But, historically, the term has more often been used as a noun, as in "the golden spike" -- the last spike driven into the ground when two locomotives were brought together at Promontory Point, Utah, at the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, bringing the country's east and west together.
Volleyball Side Out notes that when William Morgan, the YMCA physical education director in Massachusetts, invented the game he called it Mintonette.
Though the game caught on, the name seemed unappealing to many and was soon changed.
But, even today, there are still Mintonette volleyball leagues throughout the country.
